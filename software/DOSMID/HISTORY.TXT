DOSMid v0.9.6 [03 Jan 2022]
 - reset the RPN Pitch Bend between songs
 - added /preset=GM|GS|XG|NONE (preset device into specific mode, default=GM)
 - new DOSMIDLT.EXE binary ("lite" for low-memory systems), w/o AWE support
 - fixed OPL support when combined with /noxms
 - OPL emulation plays files an octave lower (suggested by Campbell Kerr)
 - low-BPM files timing fix (reported by Campbell Kerr)

DOSMid v0.9.5 [10 Dec 2018]
 - fixed file-reading module (buff corruption on first cache boundary read).

DOSMid v0.9.4 [09 Dec 2018]
 - UI displays channels as 'piano' if no instrument is explicitely loaded,
 - reduced libc dependencies (smaller footprint),
 - displaying the MIDI tracks count,
 - displaying the amount of memory used by the MIDI file,
 - backspace key jumps to previous song of the playlist,
 - minor memory optimizations,
 - fixed a memory leak in midi code,
 - fixed RIFF-RMID header decoding,
 - fixed playlist gap delay computation (fixed /delay behavior, too),
 - adaptations to compile in small memory model (smaller, faster),
 - removed /log from the default build,
 - /noxms can be passed via config file now,
 - GUS support (requires the ULTRAMID TSR).

DOSMid v0.9.3 [06 Feb 2018]
 - memory optimization (25% less RAM needed when loading files),
 - improved memory usage when using /noxms.

DOSMid v0.9.2 [06 Jun 2017]
 - fixed parsing of the /SBMIDI=xxx value (bug reported by James-F),
 - sequential playlist playing (inspired by a patch from Graham Wiseman).

DOSMid v0.9.1 [19 Nov 2016]
 - resetting channels to "all piano" before playing MIDI files,
 - syx files can be set from within DOSMID.CFG now,
 - configurable extra delay before playing files (/delay=X).

DOSMid v0.9 [21 May 2016]
 - increased SYX delaying to 40ms (solves buffering troubles on MT-32 gears),
 - fixes around how OPL percussion instruments are emulated,
 - support for custom sound banks (IBK on OPL, SBK on AWE),
 - a configuration file allows to set default settings (dosmid.cfg),
 - the 2s silence gap before songs is inserted only in playlist mode now,
 - sound hardware is initialized once, instead of being inited for every song,
 - fixed playlist parsing so DOSMid won't freeze on an empty m3u playlist,
 - load more textual information from the MIDI file (titles, markers, text),
 - file's information is displayed on a dynamic scroll when over 5 lines,
 - reorganized the display so more MIDI textual data fits on the screen,
 - fixed OPL detection for cards intolerant to hw calls during init (CT2760),
 - command-line arguments are case-insensitive,
 - renamed the /delay command-line option to /xmsdelay,
 - DOSMid refuses to play corrupted files, instead of ignoring MIDI errors.

DOSMid v0.8 [18 Sep 2015]
 - SBMIDI support (can drive MIDI synths attached to SB 1.x and 2.x cards),
 - serial (RS-232) output support (/com=xxx or /com1..4),
 - implemented 'controller' MIDI support on OPL output,
 - added support for relaying SYSEX messages to the MIDI device,
 - DOSMid adds a 2s silence gap before each song,
 - support for monochrome video modes (autodetected),
 - fixed parsing of hex I/O ports with non-numerical chars (like "3f8"),
 - reduced timing inaccuracy from ~0.02% to <0.005% (relies on PIT's quality),
 - restoring initial video mode after DOSMid quits,
 - reliable detection and reporting of out of memory conditions,
 - /noxms handles more than 64K of memory (bigger files can be played),
 - support for custom SYSEX initialization via a SYX file (/syx=FILE),
 - "expensive" features can be easily disabled at compile-time (AWE, OPL),
 - screen refresh optimizations - runs without lagging on my 8086 now.

DOSMid v0.7 [29 Jul 2015]
 - native support for SB AWE32/AWE64 sound cards (no need for AWEUTIL),
 - OPL2/OPL3 output support via emulated (waveform) GM patches,
 - support for *.MUS files, as used in many Doom-like games by Id Software,
 - optimized MIDI loading routines - MIDI files are loading twice as fast now,
 - added a pause function (space key),
 - song's filename is displayed during load time,
 - the /nodelay option is no longer default (use /delay to force).

DOSMid v0.6.1 [01 Jul 2015]
 - fixed a NULL pointer dereferencing bug,
 - possible memory access troubles are reported clearly to the user,
 - forcing GM patches to MPU because some songs rely on default instruments,
 - refactored the sound output code (and added /nosound).

DOSMid v0.6 [22 Jun 2015]
 - fixed a timing issue leading sometimes to desynchronization of tracks,
 - fixed a bug that could potentially lead to XMS memory trashing,
 - configurable MPU port via the BLASTER variable or /mpu=XXX,
 - DOSMid fails gracefully when no MPU401 is present (instead of freezing),
 - added software volume controls under '+' and '-' keys,
 - the MPU is reinitialized to default values before playing any new tracks,
 - interface fitted with a sexier color scheme,
 - using CPU-friendly calls when waiting for notes (disabled with /fullcpu),
 - very basic support for reading M3U playlists,
 - added a verbose mode for debugging needs (/log=FILE).

DOSMid v0.5 [10 Aug 2014]
 - first public release.
